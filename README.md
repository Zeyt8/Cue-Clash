# Cue-Clash

A fun twist on the 8ball pool game. Inspired by chess-boxing, players take turns between pool rounds and dueling rounds.

Sinking balls gives you ammo for the duleing round. Each ball has different stats.

Players can duel using their cue as a sword, by striking, slashing and parrying. They can also use it as a gun to shoot the gained ammo.

Whoever deals the most damage wins the duel. Damage is permanent and inflicts debuffs on the player. The winner is the first to strike in the next pool phase.

Reaching the conventional pool win condition and then winning the next dueling rounds crowns you the winner.
